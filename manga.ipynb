    "# 📚 Manga Recommendation System Using NLP & Collaborative Filtering 📚\n",
    "\n",
    "Welcome to an exciting journey into building a *Manga Recommendation System*! 🎉 In this project, we will leverage **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** and **Collaborative Filtering** to recommend mangas to users based on their preferences and reading history. Let's dive into the steps and methodologies we'll use to create this system! 🚀\n",
    "\n",
    "## Project Overview 📝\n",
    "\n",
    "The aim of this project is to create a recommendation system that suggests mangas to users. The recommendation system will analyze user preferences, the content of the mangas, and user ratings to provide personalized manga recommendations.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Steps to Create the Recommendation System 🛠️\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Data Collection 📊**\n",
    "   - Gather data on various mangas, including titles, genres, descriptions, and user ratings.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Data Preprocessing 🧹**\n",
    "   - Clean and preprocess the data, handling missing values, and normalizing the text data for NLP.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Feature Extraction using NLP 🧠**\n",
    "   - Use NLP techniques to extract meaningful features from manga descriptions and genres.\n",
    "   - Techniques like TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) will be used to convert text data into numerical features.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Collaborative Filtering Approach 🤝**\n",
    "   - Implement collaborative filtering to analyze user ratings and find similarities between users and mangas.\n",
    "   - Techniques like User-User and Item-Item Collaborative Filtering will be used to generate recommendations.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Model Training & Evaluation 📈**\n",
    "   - Train the recommendation model using the preprocessed data and extracted features.\n",
    "   - Evaluate the model's performance using metrics like Mean Squared Error (MSE) or Mean Absolute Error (MAE).\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Building the Web Interface 🌐**\n",
    "   - Create a user-friendly web interface where users can input their preferences and get manga recommendations.\n",
    "   - Implement search functionality with autocomplete to enhance user experience.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Collaborative Filtering Approach Explained 📖\n",
    "\n",
    "**Collaborative Filtering** is a technique used to make automatic predictions (filtering) about the interests of a user by collecting preferences or taste information from many users (collaborating).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Types of Collaborative Filtering:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **User-User Collaborative Filtering**\n",
    "   - This method finds users who are similar to the target user and recommends items that those similar users have liked.\n",
    "   \n",
    "2. **Item-Item Collaborative Filtering**\n",
    "   - This method finds items that are similar to the items the target user has liked in the past and recommends those items.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why Use Collaborative Filtering? 🤔\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Personalization**: Provides highly personalized recommendations by leveraging the preferences of similar users.\n",
    "- **Scalability**: Efficiently handles large datasets and generates recommendations in real-time.\n",
    "- **Simplicity**: Easy to implement and understand, making it a popular choice for recommendation systems."

    "# 📊 Data Merging and Shape Analysis 📊\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, we are working with multiple datasets containing valuable information. The goal is to merge these datasets and analyze the combined shape to ensure we have a complete and comprehensive dataset for our analysis. Let's dive into the steps involved in this process! 🚀\n",
    "\n",
    "## Step 1: Loading the Datasets 📂\n",
    "\n",
    "First, we load four different CSV files into Pandas DataFrames. Each of these files represents a dataset collected at different times:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **m1**: Data collected on April 28, 2021 📅\n",
    "- **m2**: Data collected in August 2020 📅\n",
    "- **m3**: Data collected on May 2, 2021 📅\n",
    "- **m4**: Data collected on May 3, 2021 📅\n",
    "\n",
    "By loading these datasets into separate DataFrames, we can manipulate and analyze them individually before combining them.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Step 2: Checking the Shape of Each DataFrame 🔍\n",
    "\n",
    "We print the shape of each DataFrame to understand the dimensions of our data. The shape gives us information about the number of rows and columns in each dataset:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **m1**: Checking the shape of data from April 28, 2021 🧩\n",
    "- **m2**: Checking the shape of data from August 2020 🧩\n",
    "- **m3**: Checking the shape of data from May 2, 2021 🧩\n",
    "- **m4**: Checking the shape of data from May 3, 2021 🧩\n",
    "\n",
    "This helps us verify that the data has been loaded correctly and gives us an idea of the size of each dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Step 3: Merging the Datasets 🔗\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, we use the `pd.concat()` function to merge all four DataFrames into a single DataFrame. This is done along the rows to combine all the data points:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Combining the datasets**: Merging m1, m2, m3, and m4 into a single comprehensive dataset 🧬\n",
    "\n",
    "Combining the datasets allows us to perform analysis on the entire dataset as a whole, rather than on individual parts.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Step 4: Resetting the Index 🔄\n",
    "\n",
    "After merging, we reset the index of the combined DataFrame to ensure that the index runs from 0 to the length of the DataFrame minus one. This standardizes the DataFrame for easier manipulation and analysis:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Resetting the index**: Ensuring a clean and sequential index for the merged dataset 🆕\n",
    "\n",
    "## Final Shape Analysis 📏\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, we check the shape of the merged DataFrame to understand its dimensions and ensure that all data points have been combined successfully:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Shape of merged DataFrame**: Verifying the final dimensions of our combined dataset 🔍📐\n",
    "\n",
    "This gives us a complete picture of our dataset and ensures that we are ready for the next steps in our analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "With these steps, we have successfully loaded, merged, and analyzed the shape of our multiple datasets, setting a solid foundation for further analysis and insights! 🎉📈\n"

    "\n",
    "In this section, we focus on cleaning and preprocessing our dataset `df` to ensure it is ready for analysis and modeling. Let's walk through each step involved in this process! 🚀\n",
    "\n",
    "## Step 1: Dropping Duplicates 🗑️\n",
    "\n",
    "We start by removing duplicate rows from our DataFrame `df` to ensure each entry is unique:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Dropping duplicates**: Eliminating duplicate rows to clean the dataset 🚫\n",
    "\n",
    "## Step 2: Checking Dataset Information ℹ️\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, we inspect the information about our DataFrame to understand its structure and properties:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Checking dataset info**: Obtaining information about the DataFrame structure and data types 📊\n",
    "\n",
    "## Step 3: Handling Missing Values 🕳️\n",
    "\n",
    "We then identify and handle missing values in the DataFrame `df`:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Handling missing values**: Counting and addressing missing values to maintain data integrity ⚠️\n",
    "\n",
    "## Step 4: Further Cleaning Operations ✨\n",
    "\n",
    "Continuing with data cleaning, we perform additional operations:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Removing NaN values**: Dropping rows with NaN values to ensure completeness 📉\n",
    "- **Dropping duplicates by column 'Name'**: Ensuring uniqueness based on 'Name' column for accurate analysis 🔍\n",
    "\n",
    "## Step 5: Data Quality Enhancement 📈\n",
    "\n",
    "To enhance data quality, we focus on the 'Rating' column:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Unique rating values**: Checking unique values in the 'Rating' column for data consistency 🌟\n",
    "- **Converting 'Rating' to numeric**: Converting 'Rating' column to numeric type, handling errors if any 📏\n",

    "## Step 7: Preparing Personalized DataFrame 📄\n",
    "\n",
    "Creating a `personal_df` DataFrame based on processed data for personalized analysis:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Creating personal_df**: Extracting and viewing the first three rows of `personal_df` for initial exploration 📋\n",

    "- **Dropping NaN values from 'Rating'**: Removing remaining rows with NaN values in the 'Rating' column for completeness 🗃️\n",
    "- **Resetting index**: Resetting the index of `df` for a clean, sequential order before further analysis 🔢\n",
    "\n",
    "## Step 9: Visualizing Data Distribution 📊\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "## Step 1: Removing Unnecessary Columns 🗑️\n",
    "\n",
    "We start by removing several columns from `df` that are not relevant for our current analysis:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Removing columns**: Dropping columns like 'Dated Released', 'depth', 'download_timeout', 'download_slot', 'download_latency', and 'Status' to streamline the dataset 📉\n",
    "\n",
    "## Step 2: Analyzing Manga Names 📚\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, we analyze the manga names in the dataset to gain insights:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Manga name counts**: Counting occurrences of each manga name using `value_counts()` 📊\n",
    "- **Unique manga names**: Listing unique manga names in the dataset using `unique()` 🔍\n",

    "## Step 3: Cleaning Manga Names ✨\n",
    "\n",
    "Cleaning manga names by stripping leading and trailing spaces for consistency:\n",

    "\n",
    "Extracting the latest chapter information for manga titled 'The':\n",

    "## Step 5: Handling Duplicates 🗃️\n",
    "\n",
    "Dealing with duplicates based on manga name and latest chapter to ensure data uniqueness:\n",

    "\n",
    "Resetting the index of `df` for a clean, sequential order after operations:\n",

    "## Step 7: Parsing Genre Information 🎭\n",
    "\n",
    "Parsing and transforming the 'Genre' column to a list format for easier analysis:\n",

    "# 📊 Encoding, Scaling, and Data Integration 🔄\n",
    "\n",
    "In this phase of data preparation for our Manga Recommendation System, we perform several critical tasks to enhance our dataset `df` and `main_df` for modeling and analysis purposes. Let's break down each step involved in this process! 🚀\n",
    "\n",
    "## Step 1: Genre Encoding 🎭\n",
    "\n",
    "We start by encoding the 'Genre' column using `MultiLabelBinarizer` to transform categorical genre information into a binary format:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Genre encoding**: Utilizing `MultiLabelBinarizer` to encode genres into binary format, creating `genre_encoded` 📑\n",
    "\n",
    "## Step 2: Integrating Encoded Genres into DataFrame 🔄\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, we integrate the encoded genre information back into our main dataset `df`:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Merging datasets**: Merging `df` with `genre_df` (containing encoded genres) on 'Name', replacing the original 'Genre' column 🔗\n",
    "\n",
    "## Step 3: Data Cleaning 🧼\n",
    "\n",
    "Following integration, we proceed with data cleaning tasks including:\n",
    "- **Removing duplicates**: Removing duplicate rows based on certain criteria for data integrity 🗑️\n",
    "- **Removing unnecessary columns**: Dropping columns like 'Latest Chapter' for streamlined analysis and modeling purposes 📉\n",
    "\n",
    "## Step 4: Scaling Numerical Features 📏\n",
    "\n",
    "Scaling numerical features in `df` using `MinMaxScaler` for normalization:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Feature scaling**: Applying `MinMaxScaler` to transform numerical features into a standardized range between 0 and 1 📊\n",
    "\n",
    "## Step 5: Data Integration 🔄\n",
    "\n",
    "Integrating scaled data with side information (`side_df`) back into the main dataset:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Concatenating datasets**: Concatenating `side_df` with `mx_tra` (scaled `df`) to form the finalized `df` for analysis and modeling 🔄\n",
    "\n",
    "## Step 6: Finalizing Main DataFrame 🔍\n",
    "\n",
    "Setting 'Name' as the index and ensuring uniqueness in `df` and `main_df`:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Setting index**: Setting 'Name' as the index in `df` and `main_df` to facilitate efficient data retrieval and analysis 📋\n",
    "\n",
    "## Step 7: Dataset Size Adjustment 📈\n",
    "\n",
    "Adjusting the size of `main_df` to optimize memory usage and performance:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Data trimming**: Limiting `main_df` to the first 16000 rows for manageable size and focus 📊\n",

    "In this section, we finalize the implementation of our Manga Recommendation System using collaborative filtering and cosine similarity. Here's a summary of the key steps and functionalities:\n",
    "\n",
    "## Step 1: Cosine Similarity Calculation 📊\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Cosine Similarity Matrix**: Compute cosine similarity between manga titles in `main_df`, resulting in `matched_value` matrix of shape `(16000, 16000)`.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Step 2: Single Manga Recommendation Function 📖\n",
    "\n",
    "- **manga_suggest Function**: Recommends 5 similar manga based on a given `manga_name` using cosine similarity scores. Example usage: `manga_suggest('Jujutsu Kaisen')`. 🔍\n",
    "\n",
    "## Step 3: Multiple Manga Recommendations 🌟\n",
    "\n",
    "- **mangas_suggest Function**: Retrieves detailed information about 5 similar manga titles to `manga_name`, including their genres, ratings, and image links. Example usage: `mangas_suggest('Pale Throne')`. 📚\n",
    "\n",
    "## Step 4: Saving Processed Data 📥\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Data Serialization**: Serialize the processed data into files for future use:\n",
    "  - `main_df.jbl`: Serialized `main_df` dataframe containing normalized manga data. 📦\n",
    "  - `personal_df.jbl`: Serialized `personal_df` dataframe with personalized manga information. 📋\n",
    "  - `matched_value.pkl`: Serialized `matched_value` cosine similarity matrix. 🖥️\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "By following these steps, we leverage collaborative filtering techniques to provide robust recommendations based on manga similarity, enhancing user engagement and satisfaction within our Manga Recommendation System! 🚀📘\n"
